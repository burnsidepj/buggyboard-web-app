# Introduction

I need to create a small web app for an online course that I am developing.
The course is about testing web apps with Playwright.
The app I need to create will be the system under test.
I want to use proper context engineering with AI assistance in order to build this web app.
I want to do it with excellence and with best practices.

# Web app design

I want to create a web app named "BuggyBoard" that will be a basic bug tracker.
It will have three main views:

1. a login page, where users can login with username and password
2. a board page, where users can see all the bugs that have been opened
3. a bug view, where users can view, create, edit, and delete a bug

A user has full access to all the bugs created in the app.
The theme for the app will be the classic air-cooled Volkswagen Beetle as a play on the word "Bug".

# Web app tech stack

- The web app should be a full-stack Node.js app.
- The code should be TypeScript.
- The frontend framework should be React.
- The CSS framework for the frontend should be Tailwind.
- The backend framework should be Express.
- The database should be a SQLite database.
- The test framework is Playwright. Add Playwright tests with every new feature
  so the new behavior is covered (see `specs/engineering/test-automation-patterns.md`).

# Coding standards

- Be simple and direct rather than complicated and clever.
- Resolve all errors and linter warnings.
- Keep packages up to date.
- Follow Domain Driven Design principles.
- Keep business logic in the service layer and out of the frontend as much as possible.

# Development process

I want to take a spec-first development process.
I will write a spec for every feature I want to add to the project.
The specs will include user stories, Gherkin scenarios, and other descriptions.
I want these specs to be kept as artifacts of the process.
I want the AI to set up the project and then work on each feature one by one.
After each feature is complete—including Playwright tests for the new behavior—I want the AI to pause for me to review before I direct it to move onto the next feature.
I also want the AI to track progress by saving progress to markdown files as checklists for what's been done.
Perhaps there is a better way that the AI knows how to do this. I'm open to recommendations.
Always ask me whenever there is uncertainty about a decision to make.
